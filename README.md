# Package

t.b.d.

# Setup

- download from github
- pip install .
- Add open_ai key to examples/open_ai_key (to test)

# Example

**LOOK HERE**: See examples/run_basic_script.ipynb and examples/run_basic_object.ipynb for a walkthrough of basic functionalities.

**Advanced ToDos -> too complex for current project**
- Convert tests to pytests? -> Only if testing becomes a pain (!) -> depends on how much 
- Write up better documentation
- rework testing so that it works (pytest)

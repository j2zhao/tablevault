# Package Improvements

- some things are slow -> figure why it is slow? (it was faster in the non-package version) -> suspect it might be due to file locking...Only care about UDF speed (!) -> I wanna do formating first idk. ugh

**Advanced ToDos -> too complex for current project**
- Convert tests to pytests? -> Only if testing becomes a pain (!) -> depends on how much 
- Write up better documentation
- rework testing so that it works (pytest)

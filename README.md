# Welcome to TableVault

TableVault is a tool to manage data artifacts in **complex and dynamic data workflows**. It enables the **reusability of data** by ensuring that the complete context of data transformations is captured, and that data states are atomic and transactional (transformations clearly succeed or fail). Its designed to work well with various Python data science libraries and tools (Jupyter notebooks, Colab, Pandas, Numpy, transformers, and etc).

TableVault is particularly suited to deal with workflows that deal with multiple dataframes, external artifacts (images, videos, documents, and etc), and **large language model executions**. Check out the [Examples]() section for more detailed applications.

You can install the tool with:

``` unixconfig

!pip install "git+https://github.com/j2zhao/tablevault.git"

```

This library has been tested for `Python>=3.11`.


**Note:** Will be uploaded to the Python Package Index officially in July 2025.
